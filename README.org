This repository is part of the [[https://www.evo-land.eu/][EVOLAND Horizon Europe]] project.
It provides a User Defined Function to extract Sentinel-2 or Sentinel-1 satellite image time series embeddings with MALICE model.
The input time series can have any length, although the recommended length is between 6 and 18 months.
The output embeddings have fixed size of (10 x 64) x H x W

The respository include the [[file:src/openeo_mmdc/udf_s2.py][User Defined Function for S2]] and [[file:src/openeo_mmdc/udf_s1_asc.py][User Defined Function for S1]]
implemented using a ONNX export of the best model, as well as a [[file:src/openeo_mmdc/run.py][runtime script]] allowing to use it with your OpenEO account.

* Installation
#+begin_src shell
$ pip install -e git+https://github.com/Evoland-Land-Monitoring-Evolution/openeo_mmdc.git
